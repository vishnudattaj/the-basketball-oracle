## 🧠 AI Search Toggle

A smart toggle lets users switch between:

- **Stat Search:** Fast access to raw stats and career data using `nba_api`.
- **AI Search:** Ask natural language questions powered by a semantic RAG pipeline.

Example queries:
- *How did analytics change player scouting in the NBA?*
- *Has switch-heavy defense redefined what it means to be a ‘good defender’?*
- *Why was Luka Doncic traded?*

Input sanitization has been expanded to support natural phrasing, punctuation, and smart quotes.
