## How It's Made 🔧

**Tech Stack:** Flask, Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript

The application was built using the Flask framework. It uses `nba_api` to access player data and team rosters, and utilizes ESPN's hidden APIs to access scoreboard data. HTML and CSS are used for rendering templates, while JavaScript is employed for displaying the scoreboard, implementing a password check feature, and adding a light-dark mode toggle.

To classify players into categories, I used KMeans clustering with scikit-learn. The testing and training data was sourced from Kaggle's datasets. For predicting future stats, I used XGBoost Regression to forecast points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks based on past performance data.

**NBA Data Source:** The player and team data is sourced from the [nba_api](https://github.com/swar/nba_api), a Python library that provides access to the NBA's official API.
